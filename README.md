**Gork Build: the VSCodium-style community build of Grok Build — [research / product analytics hard-off](https://gist.github.com/cereblab/dc9a40bc26120f4540e4e09b75ffb547)**

An independent, community-maintained distribution of
[SpaceXAI Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build) with vendor
telemetry hard-off and a community rebrand (compatibility identifiers such as
`~/.grok`, `GROK_*`, and API hosts are retained).

**Privacy note:** agent-selected model context (prompts, tool results, file
contents the agent reads) still goes to the model API — that is how cloud
coding works. Research uploads and product analytics are hard-off separately;
they are not the same channel.

**Gork Build is to [Grok Build](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build) what
[VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) is to VS Code**, and what
[ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)
is to Chromium.

This GitHub repository is **not** a full Rust checkout. Like
[VSCodium](https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium) and
[ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium),
it holds a patch queue, overlays, and CI that fetch a pinned
[`xai-org/grok-build`](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build) revision and
apply privacy hard-offs. Compatibility identifiers (`~/.grok`, `GROK_*`, API
hosts) are kept.

Comparison at a glance:

| | Grok Build (upstream) | **Gork Build** (this fork) |
|--|----------------------|---------------------------|
| License | Apache-2.0 | Apache-2.0 (same code) |
| Agent / tools / TUI | Full | Full |
| Model inference | Yes (Grok API) | Yes (your credentials) |
| Mixpanel / product events | On by default in releases | **Hard-off** |
| GCS research / session traces | Upload pipeline present | **Hard-off** |
| Whole-repo research packaging | Present upstream | **Disabled** |
| Vendor auto-update | Yes (`x.ai/cli`) | **Hard-disabled** (rebuild / community releases) |
| Coding-data retention | Opt-in available | **Opt-out only (locked)** |
| OpenAI-compatible gateways | Grok/xAI wire extensions | Optional `openai_compat = "strict"` |
| API-key model catalog | Built-in ids + config | Pinned API-key mode uses explicit `[model.*]` only |

## Why this exists

Independent [wire analysis of Grok Build 0.2.93](https://gist.github.com/cereblab/dc9a40bc26120f4540e4e09b75ffb547)
showed that research upload paths (session traces, and historically whole-repo
snapshots) could leave the machine even when “Improve the model” was off —
including secrets in files the agent read. Upstream open-sourced the harness;
**Gork Build** re-ships that code with **privacy by construction**:

- No product analytics (Mixpanel / `events` telemetry)
- No client-side research / trace / session-state uploads to GCS
- Remote feature flags **cannot** re-enable those paths
- Coding-data retention is **opt-out only** (no opt-in path)
- Vendor auto-update is **hard-disabled**: Gork Build never installs from
  x.ai update channels (`x.ai/cli/install.*`); that path would replace this
  fork with official Grok Build. Update by rebuilding from source or installing
  community releases from **this** project.

**What still leaves the machine:** whatever the agent must send to the Grok
**model API** to work (prompts + tool results for files it actually reads).
That is required for a cloud coding agent and is separate from the research /
product-analytics hard-offs. Gork Build does not add extra research packaging
on top.

## Install

Prefer a [GitHub Release](https://github.com/thedavidweng/gork-build/releases)
binary (`gork-<tag>-<platform>.tar.gz` / `.zip`). Those are the patched
product builds. CI extracts every shipped archive and runs the binary
(`--version`, `--help`, and `update` must refuse vendor installers) before
the release is published, then re-downloads the published assets and smokes
them again. Vendor `x.ai/cli` installers are hard-disabled — they would
overwrite this fork with official Grok Build.

macOS binaries are unsigned:

```sh
xattr -d com.apple.quarantine gork
```

Put `gork` on your `PATH`. An optional `grok` alias is fine if you want the
upstream command name.

## Build from source

This repo is a **recipe** (patches + scripts), like VSCodium or
ungoogled-chromium. Clone it, materialize upstream + patches, then compile:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/thedavidweng/gork-build.git
cd gork-build
python3 maint/scripts/patchctl.py checkout   # or ./scripts/dev.sh
# → .work/src  (gitignored product tree)

cd .work/src
# Rust toolchain: rust-toolchain.toml in this tree
# protoc: bin/protoc, a system protoc, or $PROTOC
cargo run -p xai-grok-pager-bin              # TUI binary: gork
cargo build -p xai-grok-pager-bin --release  # target/release/gork
```

On first launch, authenticate with your Grok / xAI account the same way
upstream does — model access still goes through the Grok API.

### What's in this repository

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| `maint/patches/` | Privacy / identity patch series (the delta vs upstream) |
| `maint/overlays/` | Community README, PRIVACY, assets applied on checkout |
| `maint/upstream.lock.toml` | Pinned `xai-org/grok-build` SHA + version |
| `maint/scripts/patchctl.py` | `checkout`, `apply`, `export`, `lint`, sync |
| `.github/workflows/` | Privacy contracts, replay, community releases |
| `.work/src/` | **Not committed.** Created by `checkout`. |

Edit behavior in `.work/src`, then from the repo root:

```sh
python3 maint/scripts/patchctl.py export --tip HEAD
```

That rewrites `maint/patches/`. Do not expect a `crates/` tree on `main`.

## Privacy guarantees (client)

| Channel | Gork Build behavior |
|---------|-------------------|
| `POST …/v1/responses` (model) | Used for inference only |
| `POST …/v1/storage` research traces | **Never enabled** (`resolve_trace_upload` → false) |
| Mixpanel / product events | **No-op / never constructed** |
| Sentry | Only if you set `SENTRY_DSN` yourself |
| Vendor auto-update (`x.ai/cli/install.*`) | **Hard-disabled** — rebuild from source / community releases |
| `is_data_collection_disabled` | Always **true** in this build |

See [`PRIVACY.md`](PRIVACY.md) for details and residual risks.

## Configuration tips

```toml
# ~/.grok/config.toml — all of these are already the Gork Build defaults
[features]
telemetry = false

[telemetry]
trace_upload = false
mixpanel_enabled = false
```

`[cli] auto_update` cannot re-enable vendor channels: this build never installs
from x.ai (enforced at the install chokepoint). Rebuild from source or use
community releases.

## Custom models

Gork Build adds two knobs on top of upstream custom models.

### Strict OpenAI wire

Some OpenAI-compatible gateways reject Grok/xAI request extensions. Set this on
a `[model.*]` entry:

```toml
[model.gateway-gpt]
model = "gpt-5"
base_url = "https://gateway.example/v1"
api_backend = "responses"   # or "chat_completions"
openai_compat = "strict"
```

`openai_compat = "strict"` is supported with `chat_completions` and `responses`.
It suppresses Grok/xAI-only headers and extensions, keeps standard OpenAI
fields, and in Chat Completions uses `max_completion_tokens`, drops Grok
assistant metadata, and moves tool-returned images out of `role = "tool"` into
a following user multimodal message.

The default is `openai_compat = "native"`. Do not combine `strict` with
`api_backend = "messages"` (Anthropic Messages). The same text is patched into
the upstream user guide after checkout:

`.work/src/crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/11-custom-models.md`

### API-key BYOK and model pick

Pinned API-key mode (`[auth] preferred_method = "api_key"`) is treated as pure
BYOK:

- only explicit `[model.*]` entries stay in the catalog
- a session slug such as `grok` is not collapsed onto the built-in `grok-4.6` row
- so `[model.grok]` with `model = "grok-4.6"` can remain your gateway alias
- API-key 401s stay API-key errors; they are not rewritten into OAuth / WebLogin `/login`

```toml
[auth]
preferred_method = "api_key"

[model.grok]
model = "grok-4.6"
base_url = "https://gateway.example/v1"
api_key = "sk-..."
api_backend = "responses"
openai_compat = "strict"
```

## Documentation

Feature docs ship with upstream and appear after checkout:

`.work/src/crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide/`

Or read the same tree on
[`xai-org/grok-build`](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build/tree/main/crates/codegen/xai-grok-pager/docs/user-guide).

## Relationship to upstream

Gork Build **tracks** [`xai-org/grok-build`](https://github.com/xai-org/grok-build).
CI fetches a locked upstream SHA, applies `maint/patches/`, and publishes
community binaries. When the series applies cleanly, a draft PR updates only
the lock and patches — not a wholesale copy of the upstream tree.
